How about playing an Android car game?
There is a road in the game and it is an android game that tries to move forward without hitting the objects next to the car.
In the game, when the car hits any object, the game is lost and the highest score played on that screen is written on the screen.
They will play the game and consume energy and then have to wait for it to be released. Charge before playing again. After a few seconds the user is notified and can continue the game. Thus, the energy system will be created.
 The user receives a notification and the user can connect to the gam.
